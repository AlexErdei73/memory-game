The beauty of the basic laws \nof natural science, as revealed in the study of particles and of the cosmos, is allied to the litheness of a merganser diving in a pure \nSwedish lake, or the grace of a dolphin leaving shining trails at night in the Gulf of California.","Sustainability is living on nature's income rather than living on its capital.","Everything that is not forbidden is compulsory.","If I have seen further than others, it is because I am surrounded by dwarfs.","What is especially striking and remarkable is that in fundamental physics, a beautiful or elegant theory is more likely to be \nright than a theory that is inelegant. A theory appears to be beautiful or elegant (or simple, if you prefer) when it can be expressed \nconcisely in terms of mathematics we already have. Symmetry exhibits the simplicity. The Foundamental Law is such that the different \nskins of the onion resemble one another and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply the phenomenon \nof the next skin.","If someone says that he can think or talk about quantum physics without becoming dizzy, that shows only that he has not \nunderstood anything whatever about it.","Of course the word chaos is used in rather a vague sense by a lot of writers, but in physics it means a particular phenomenon, \nnamely that in a nonlinear system the outcome is often indefinitely, arbitrarily sensitive to tiny changes in the initial condition",'The mathematics clearly called for a set of underlying elementary objects-at that time we needed three types of them-elementary\nobjects that could be combined three at a time in different ways to make all the heavy particles we knew. ... I needed a name for them and \ncalled them quarks, after the taunting cry of the gulls, "Three quarks for Muster mark," from Finnegan\'s Wake by the Irish writer \nJames Joyce.',"All of modern physics is governed by that magnificent and thoroughly confusing discipline called quantum mechanics ... It has \nsurvived all tests and there is no reason to believe that there is any flaw in it. We all know how to use it and how to apply it to \nproblems; and so we have learned to live with the fact that nobody can understand it."," Niels Bohr brainwashed a whole generation of theorists into thinking that the job (interpreting quantum theory) \nwas done 50 years ago.","If you know the wavefunction of the universe, why aren't you rich?","I thought of killing myself but soon decided that I could always try MIT and then kill myself later if it was that bad \nbut that I couldn't commit suicide and then try MIT afterwards. The two operations, suicide and going to MIT, don't commute."]},{name:"Sheldon Glashow",from:"1932",to:"",image:"./images/sheldon-glashow.jpeg",quotes:["Tapestries are made by many artisans working together. The contributions of separate workers \ncannot be discerned in the completed work, and the loose and false threads have been covered over. \nSo it is in our picture of particle physics.",'We called the new [fourth] quark the "charmed quark" because we were pleased, and fascinated \nby the symmetry it brought to the subnuclear world.

Without it you would have good people doing good things \nand evil people doing evil things.

Many people do simply awful things out of sincere religious belief, not using religion as \na cover the way that Saddam Hussein may have done, but really because they believe that this is what \nGod wants them to do, going all the way back to Abraham being willing to sacrifice Isaac because God \ntold him to do that. Putting God ahead of humanity is a terrible thing."," I have a friend \u2014 or had a friend, now dead \u2014 Abdus Salam, a very devout Muslim, who was trying \nto bring science into the universities in the Gulf states and he told me that he had a terrible time because, \nalthough they were very receptive to technology, they felt that science would be a corrosive to religious \nbelief, and they were worried about it\u2026 and damn it, I think they were right.
